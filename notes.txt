NodeJS
******
    - NodeJS is backend Technology

    - we will develop NodeJS Applications with the help of JavaScript

    - NodeJS depending on ExpressJS Framework to develop Rest API'S

                GET

                POST

                PUT

                DELETE

                ---
                ---
                ---

    - we will test above Rest API'S with the help of "Postman".


    - NodeJS supports libraries/modules.

    - above libraries we will download with the help of "yarn/npm" tool
